# Othello
Author: Shreya Roy

Version: 10/17/18

As part of my Object-Oriented Programming class during my first semester at Purdue University, I developed the game, Othello (AKA Reversi), using IntelliJ and Java programming.

## Usage
Reversi.java is run to start the game. The game begins by printing the starting board for the game out to the user, who looks at the prompt and types in the row and column at which they want to add a new piece. The game follows the rules of the board game, Othello/Reversi, and the game ends when neither player can move or when the board fills up. This version of the game is a live multiplayer game, meaning that the user can't play against the computer, only against another person.
